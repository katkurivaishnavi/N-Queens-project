# N-Queens Problem (NxN)

## Description
This project solves the classic N-Queens problem using a backtracking approach.
The goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

## Objectives
- Represent the chessboard using a 2D array
- Place queens safely using backtracking
- Ensure no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal

## Algorithm Used
Backtracking

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python n_queens.py
